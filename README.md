# Trash Image Classification Using SVM and Convolutional Neural Networks

This project implements and compares traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches for automated waste classification. It evaluates the performance of **SVM (with HOG & LBP features)**, a **Standard CNN**, and **ResNet-50** on a large-scale garbage dataset.

## 📖 Introduction

Efficient automatic waste classification is essential for optimizing recycling and addressing environmental challenges. This study develops an image-based classification system to categorize residential and commercial waste into 10 distinct classes. We specifically address challenges like inter-class similarity (e.g., paper vs. cardboard) and cluttered backgrounds using both handcrafted feature engineering and deep hierarchical learning.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **Garbage Classification Dataset (V2)** from Kaggle:

* 
**Total Images**: 19,407.


* 
**Categories**: 10 classes including Battery, Biological, Glass, Cardboard, Clothes, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Shoes, and Trash.


* 
**Data Split**: 64% Training, 16% Validation, and 20% Testing.



## 🛠 Methodology

### 1. Traditional Machine Learning (SVM)

A robust baseline using handcrafted features:

* **Feature Extraction**:
* 
**Multi-Scale LBP**: Captures texture at radii , resulting in a 768-dimensional descriptor.


* 
**Color-Optimized HOG**: Operates directly on RGB channels to preserve color-texture interactions for better structural capture.




* 
**Processing**: High-dimensional features (10,000+) are compressed using **PCA** to the top 4,096 principal components.


* 
**Classifier**: SVM with a **Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel**.



### 2. Deep Learning (CNN & ResNet)

* 
**Standard CNN**: A custom architecture utilizing sequential convolution, ReLU activation, and max-pooling layers to learn spatial hierarchies automatically.


* 
**ResNet-50**: Utilizes **Transfer Learning** and residual blocks with skip connections to mitigate performance degradation in deep networks.



## 📈 Results

The experimental results demonstrate that deep learning significantly outperforms traditional methods.

| Method | Accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| **SVM + HOG + LBP** | 77.06% |
| **Standard CNN** | 86.60% |
| **ResNet-50** | **96.40%** |

* 
**Conclusion**: While handcrafted features provide a solid baseline (77.06%), the ResNet-50 model achieves the highest accuracy (96.40%) by effectively learning high-level representations for complex waste images.



## 🚀 How to Run

1. 
**Preprocessing**: Input images are resized and normalized.


2. 
**SVM Pipeline**: Run the GPU-accelerated HOG/LBP extractors followed by PCA and SVM training.


3. 
**Deep Learning**: Fine-tune the ResNet-50 model using a small learning rate for stable convergence.
