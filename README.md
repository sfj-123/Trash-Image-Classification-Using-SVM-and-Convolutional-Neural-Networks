# Trash-Image-Classification-Using-SVM-and-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
In terms of methods, we compared the traditional machine learning schemes based on  artificial features and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the deep learning models of Convolutional Neural Network  (CNN) and Residual Network (ResNet).
